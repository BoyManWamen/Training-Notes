Compilers are software tools that translate high-level programming code written by humans into machine code or an intermediate code that can be executed by a computer's hardware. The process involves several stages, collectively known as the compilation process. Here is an overview of how compilers work:

1. Lexical Analysis:
Task: Breaks the source code into tokens.
Components:
Lexer/Scanner: Reads the source code character by character and groups them into tokens.
Token: Represents a meaningful unit (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators).
2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing):
Task: Builds a syntax tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens.
Components:
Parser: Analyzes the structure of the code based on grammar rules.
Syntax Tree/AST: Represents the hierarchical structure of the code.
3. Semantic Analysis:
Task: Checks the code for semantic errors and gathers information about variable types and scope.
Components:
Semantic Analyzer: Ensures that the code adheres to the language's semantics.
Symbol Table: Stores information about variables, functions, and their scope.
4. Intermediate Code Generation:
Task: Translates the source code into an intermediate representation.
Components:
Intermediate Code Generator: Produces an intermediate code that is independent of the target machine.
Intermediate Code: Simplified and machine-independent representation.
5. Code Optimization:
Task: Improves the intermediate code for better performance.
Components:
Optimizer: Applies various optimization techniques, such as constant folding, loop optimization, and dead code elimination.
6. Code Generation:
Task: Translates the optimized intermediate code into machine code for a specific target architecture.
Components:
Code Generator: Converts the intermediate code into machine code.
Target Machine Code: Architecture-specific instructions.
7. Code Linking and Assembly:
Task: Combines multiple files, resolves references, and produces an executable.
Components:
Linker: Combines object files into a single executable.
Assembler: Converts assembly code into machine code.
8. Output:
Task: Generates the final executable file.
Components:
Executable: The compiled program ready for execution.
9. Debugging Information:
Task: Embeds information for debugging purposes.
Components:
Debug Information Generator: Includes data for debugging tools to map machine instructions back to the source code.
