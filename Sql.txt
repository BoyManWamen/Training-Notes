I. Introduction to SQL:
A. SQL Definition:
1. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
2. Standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

B. Purpose:
1. Querying and retrieving data from databases.
2. Defining and modifying database structure.
3. Managing user permissions and security.

II. Basic SQL Commands:
A. SELECT Statement:
1. Retrieves data from one or more tables.
2. Basic syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

B. INSERT Statement:
1. Adds new records to a table.
2. Basic syntax: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

C. UPDATE Statement:
1. Modifies existing records in a table.
2. Basic syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;

D. DELETE Statement:
1. Removes records from a table.
2. Basic syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

III. Querying Data:
A. Filtering Data:
1. WHERE clause for conditional filtering.
2. Comparison operators (e.g., =, <>, <, >).

B. Sorting Data:
1. ORDER BY clause for sorting results.
2. ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending) options.

C. Aggregating Data:
1. Aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
2. GROUP BY clause for grouping results.

D. Joining Tables:
1. Combining data from multiple tables.
2. Types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.

IV. Modifying Database Structure:
A. Creating Tables:
1. CREATE TABLE statement.
2. Specifying column names, data types, and constraints.

B. Altering Tables:
1. ALTER TABLE statement for modifying existing tables.
2. Adding, modifying, or dropping columns.

C. Dropping Tables:
1. DROP TABLE statement for removing tables.

V. Data Constraints:
A. PRIMARY KEY:
1. Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
2. Ensures data integrity.

B. FOREIGN KEY:
1. Establishes a link between two tables.
2. Ensures referential integrity.

C. UNIQUE Constraint:
1. Ensures that values in a column are unique.

D. NOT NULL Constraint:
1. Requires a column to have a value.

VI. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
A. Transaction Control:
1. COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements.

B. Savepoints:
1. Set and rollback to intermediate points within a transaction.

VII. Views and Indexes:
A. Creating Views:
1. Virtual tables based on the result of a SELECT query.

B. Indexes:
1. Improves the speed of data retrieval operations.
2. Created using CREATE INDEX statement.

VIII. Advanced SQL Concepts:
A. Subqueries:
1. Nested queries within other queries.
2. Used for complex filtering and data retrieval.

B. Stored Procedures and Functions:
1. Precompiled SQL code for repetitive tasks.
2. Parameters and return values.

IX. Security and Permissions:
A. GRANT and REVOKE statements:
1. Managing user access and permissions.
