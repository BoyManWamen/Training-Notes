Introduction:
Definition:

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the running time of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
Purpose:

Provides a standardized way to express the efficiency of an algorithm and its scalability with increasing input sizes.
Key Concepts:
Time Complexity:

Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input.
Space Complexity:

Measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the size of its input.
Syntax:
O(f(n)):

Read as "Big O of f(n)."
Describes an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's time or space complexity.
f(n):

Represents a mathematical function of the input size n.
Common Time Complexities:
O(1) - Constant Time:

The algorithm's running time remains constant, regardless of the input size.
Example: Accessing an element in an array using its index.
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:

The running time grows logarithmically with the input size.
Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
O(n) - Linear Time:

The running time grows linearly with the input size.
Example: Finding the maximum element in an unsorted array.
O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time:

Common in algorithms with divide-and-conquer strategies.
Example: Efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort.
O(n^2) - Quadratic Time:

The running time grows proportional to the square of the input size.
Example: Nested loops iterating over a 2D array.
O(2^n) - Exponential Time:

The running time doubles with each additional input.
Example: Brute-force algorithms for problems like the Traveling Salesman.
Practical Considerations:
Dominant Terms:

Focus on the most significant terms in the expression to determine the overall time complexity.
Ignore Constants:

In Big O notation, constants are disregarded, as the focus is on the growth rate.
Best, Average, Worst Case:

Big O notation often describes the worst-case scenario, but sometimes average or best-case complexities are considered.
Applications:
Algorithmic Analysis:

Helps compare and choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.
System Design:

Guides the design of scalable and performant software systems.
Limitations:
Simplified View:

Big O notation provides an upper bound, but it might not capture the real-world performance in all scenarios.
Constant Factors:

Ignores constant factors, which can be significant in practical implementations.
