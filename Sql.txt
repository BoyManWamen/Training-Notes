I. Introduction to SQL:
A. SQL Definition:
1. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
2. Essential for tasks like data retrieval, modification, and database administration.

B. Types of SQL Statements:
1. Data Query Language (DQL): SELECT
2. Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
3. Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
4. Data Control Language (DCL): GRANT, REVOKE

II. Basic SQL Commands:
A. SELECT Statement:
1. Foundation for data retrieval.
2. Syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

B. Filtering Data:
1. WHERE clause for conditional filtering.
2. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).

C. Sorting Data:
1. ORDER BY clause for arranging results.
2. ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending) options.

III. Working with Tables:
A. Creating Tables:
1. DDL command: CREATE TABLE.
2. Define columns, data types, and constraints.

B. Altering Tables:
1. DDL command: ALTER TABLE.
2. Add, modify, or drop columns.

C. Dropping Tables:
1. DDL command: DROP TABLE.
2. Removes the entire table.

IV. Data Constraints:
A. PRIMARY KEY:
1. Uniquely identifies records in a table.
2. Ensures data integrity.

B. FOREIGN KEY:
1. Establishes relationships between tables.
2. Maintains referential integrity.

C. UNIQUE Constraint:
1. Ensures uniqueness of values in a column.

D. NOT NULL Constraint:
1. Requires a column to have a value.

V. Advanced SQL Concepts:
A. Joins:
1. Combining data from multiple tables.
2. Types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN.

B. Subqueries:
1. Nested queries within other queries.
2. Used for complex filtering and data retrieval.

C. Stored Procedures and Functions:
1. Precompiled SQL code for reuse.
2. Parameters and return values.

VI. Data Modification:
A. INSERT Statement:
1. Adds new records to a table.

B. UPDATE Statement:
1. Modifies existing records in a table.

C. DELETE Statement:
1. Removes records from a table.

VII. Security and Permissions:
A. GRANT and REVOKE Statements:
1. Manage user access and permissions.
2. Enhances database security.
