Key Concepts:
Decentralization:

Blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes).
No single entity has control, making it resistant to censorship or tampering.
Distributed Ledger:

The ledger is a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions.
Every participating node has a copy of the entire blockchain.
Consensus Mechanism:

Nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions through a consensus mechanism.
Common mechanisms include Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin) and Proof-of-Stake.
Process Overview:
Transaction Initiation:

A participant initiates a transaction, creating a digital record of the exchange.
Transaction Verification:

The transaction is broadcast to the network.
Nodes validate the transaction's legitimacy, checking factors like digital signatures and available funds.
Transaction Block Formation:

Validated transactions are grouped into a block.
Each block contains a reference to the previous block, creating a chain.
Consensus:

Nodes in the network reach a consensus on the validity of the new block.
This involves solving a cryptographic puzzle in Proof-of-Work or a stake-based decision in Proof-of-Stake.
Block Addition:

Once consensus is reached, the new block is added to the chain.
The block is linked to the previous one through a hash function.
Decentralized Consensus:

All nodes update their copies of the blockchain with the new block.
Consensus ensures that all nodes have the same version of the ledger.
Key Components:
Cryptographic Hash Functions:

Used to secure the integrity of data within a block.
Any change in the block content results in a completely different hash.
Public and Private Keys:

Public keys are used as addresses for receiving funds.
Private keys, known only to the owner, are used for signing transactions.
Smart Contracts (in some blockchain platforms):

Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
Automatically enforce rules and execute actions based on predefined conditions.
Advantages of Blockchain:
Security:

Cryptographic techniques make the blockchain secure and tamper-resistant.
Transparency:

The entire transaction history is visible to all participants in the network.
Immutability:

Once a block is added, it is extremely difficult to alter the information within it.
Decentralization:

No single point of control reduces the risk of censorship and enhances resilience.
Trustless System:

Participants do not need to trust a central authority; they trust the protocol and the consensus mechanism.
