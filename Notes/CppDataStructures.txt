C++ is a versatile programming language that allows developers to implement various data structures. Here's a list of commonly used data structures in C++:

Array:

A fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
Vector:

A dynamic array that can resize itself.
List:

A doubly-linked list or a singly-linked list, which allows for easy insertion and removal of elements.
Deque (Double-ended queue):

A dynamic array that allows insertion and deletion at both ends.
Queue:

A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Stack:

A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Set:

A collection of unique elements, typically implemented using trees or hash tables.
Map:

A collection of key-value pairs, also implemented using trees or hash tables.
Multiset:

Similar to a set, but allows duplicate elements.
Multimap:

Similar to a map, but allows multiple key-value pairs with the same key.
Queue (Priority Queue):

A queue in which elements have priorities, and the element with the highest priority is served before others.
Stack (Priority Stack):

Similar to a priority queue, but follows the LIFO principle.
Heap:

A binary heap or a more generalized form, used for priority queues.
Tree:

Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.
Graph:

A collection of nodes and edges, with various representations such as adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
Hash Table:

A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
String:

A sequence of characters, often represented as an array or a class in C++.
Bitset:

A specialized container that holds bits and supports efficient bitwise operations.
Tuple:

An ordered set of elements, each potentially of a different type.
Queue (Double-ended queue - std::deque):

Similar to std::queue, but allows insertion and deletion at both ends.
Forward List:

A singly-linked list, similar to std::list but with one-way links.
These are just some of the commonly used data structures in C++. Depending on the specific needs of a program, developers may choose the appropriate data structure to optimize performance and meet the requirements of their algorithms.
