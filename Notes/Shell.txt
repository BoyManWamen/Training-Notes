Shell Basics:

Definition:

A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for interacting with the operating system. Common shells include Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Zsh, and PowerShell.
Prompt:

The command prompt is where you enter commands. It often includes information about the user, host, current directory, and more.
Commands:

Commands are instructions given to the shell. They can be simple, like ls (list files), or complex, involving pipes, redirects, and more.
File System Navigation:

cd: Change directory
pwd: Print working directory
ls: List files and directories
mkdir: Create a directory
cp: Copy files or directories
mv: Move or rename files or directories
rm: Remove files or directories
touch: Create an empty file
File Manipulation:

Text Editors:

Use text editors like nano, vim, or emacs to create and edit files directly from the command line.
File Viewing:

cat: Concatenate and display file content
less or more: View files one screen at a time
head and tail: Display the beginning or end of a file
Redirection and Pipes:

Redirection:

>: Redirect output to a file (overwrite)
>>: Redirect output to a file (append)
<: Redirect input from a file
Pipes:

|: Pipe command output to another command. Example: command1 | command2
Variables and Environment:

Variables:

Assign values to variables: variable_name=value
Access variable value: $variable_name
Environment Variables:

Predefined variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user environment. Example: $HOME, $PATH, $USER
Shell Scripting:

Shebang:

Start scripts with a shebang (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter.
Variables in Scripts:

Use variables to store and retrieve values within scripts.
Control Structures:

Use if, else, elif, for, and while for control flow.
Functions:

Define functions to group and reuse code within scripts.
Command-Line Arguments:

Access arguments passed to a script using $1, $2, etc.
Exit Codes:

Scripts return exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for failure).
Permissions and Security:

chmod:

Change file permissions. Example: chmod +x script.sh (make script executable)
