Cryptography Student Notes

1. Introduction to Cryptography:
Cryptography is the science of secure communication.
Two main objectives: confidentiality and integrity.
2. Types of Cryptography:
a. Symmetric Cryptography:
- Uses a shared key for both encryption and decryption.
- Fast but requires secure key exchange.

b. Asymmetric Cryptography:
- Uses a pair of public and private keys.
- Slower but provides secure key exchange.

3. Key Concepts:
a. Encryption:
- Process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.

b. Decryption:
- Process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.

4. Common Algorithms:
a. Symmetric Algorithms:
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- DES (Data Encryption Standard).

b. Asymmetric Algorithms:
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

5. Hash Functions:
Transform input data into a fixed-size string of characters.
Used for data integrity and digital signatures.
Examples: SHA-256, MD5.
6. Digital Signatures:
Ensures the authenticity and integrity of a message.
Combines hashing and asymmetric cryptography.
7. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):
Framework for managing digital keys and certificates.
Enables secure communication over insecure networks.
8. Cryptographic Protocols:
a. SSL/TLS:
- Securing internet communication.

b. IPsec:
- Securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications.

9. Cryptanalysis:
Science of breaking codes and ciphers.
Analyzing vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.
10. Challenges and Considerations:
a. Key Management:
- Secure generation, distribution, and storage.

b. Quantum Cryptography:
- Addressing threats from quantum computers.

11. Applications:
a. E-commerce:
- Securing online transactions.

b. Blockchain:
- Ensuring the security of decentralized systems.

12. Legal and Ethical Implications:
Compliance with data protection laws.
Ethical considerations in cryptography research.
