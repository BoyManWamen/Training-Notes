I. Overview of Computer Networks


A. Definition of Computer Networks
1. A collection of interconnected devices
2. Facilitates communication and resource sharing

B. Importance of Computer Networks
1. Efficient data transfer
2. Resource sharing (hardware, software, data)
3. Improved communication

II. Types of Computer Networks

A. Based on Size
1. Personal Area Network (PAN)
2. Local Area Network (LAN)
3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
4. Wide Area Network (WAN)

B. Based on Connection Method
1. Point-to-Point
2. Point-to-Multipoint
3. Multipoint-to-Multipoint

III. Network Topologies

A. Bus Topology
1. Single central cable
2. Nodes connected to the cable

B. Star Topology
1. Central hub connected to nodes
2. Nodes communicate through the hub

C. Ring Topology
1. Circular connection of nodes
2. Data travels in one direction

D. Mesh Topology
1. Every node connected to every other node
2. Redundancy for reliability

E. Hybrid Topology
1. Combination of two or more topologies
2. Offers flexibility and scalability

IV. Network Protocols

A. Definition and Purpose
1. Set of rules for communication
2. Ensures data integrity and security

B. Common Protocols
1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
2. HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)
3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
4. DNS (Domain Name System)
5. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

V. OSI Model

A. Seven Layers
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

B. Functions of Each Layer
1. Physical Layer - Hardware transmission
2. Data Link Layer - Framing, error detection
3. Network Layer - Routing, logical addressing
4. Transport Layer - End-to-end communication
5. Session Layer - Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections
6. Presentation Layer - Data translation, encryption
7. Application Layer - User interface, network services

VI. Network Devices

A. Router
1. Connects multiple networks
2. Routes data between them

B. Switch
1. Connects devices within a network
2. Forwards data based on MAC addresses

C. Hub
1. Basic network connectivity
2. Broadcasts data to all connected devices

D. Modem
1. Converts digital signals to analog (for analog transmission)

VII. Network Security

A. Firewalls
1. Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic
2. Prevents unauthorized access

B. Encryption
1. Converts data into a secure code
2. Protects data during transmission

C. Authentication
1. Verifies the identity of users/devices
2. Ensures only authorized access
